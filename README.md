English PAbjad
==============

The Phonetic English [Abjad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad) (eg. [Arabic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_Alphabet), [Hebrew](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_Alphabet) -they have no vowels, they hav nuw vawlz, thy hv nw vwlz) is a proposal for an alternate English othography (spelling system).  

Technically, it is not a pure abjad as occaisonally some vowels are retained. This avoids having, some selected common words, collapsing into homographs (like the [textonyms](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=textonym) - Her neighbours' noisey cock(/???/2625) kept disturbing her morning sleep. Or any Officer Crabtree-esq 'miscomunications'; a) [th brtsh erfs hv drpd thr bms on th wtrwks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DrAp5gzdqc); b) [.. undr th lmp pst thr ar tw tts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGNVU5ZjlgA)).  

Additionally the English PAdjad diverges from a traditional abjad in one further respect: some common words are not only contracted by vowel removal, but also by abbrieviation to TLA (three letter acronymn) - eg. government -> gvt.

###Problems with TS (Traditional Spelling)  
* perverse    
lack of consistent phonetic regularity (of symbol -> sound, and sound-> to symbol)  
* verbose   
 an average [<sup>on the authority of bruhaha, barbara, and shane</sup>](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080526032554AAB28AF) word, of 5 letters, specifies (26x26x26x26x26) nearly 12 million combinations which is inefficient encoding of vocabulary sizes which rarely exceed 100 thousand words

###Just [TOTALLY FUBAR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FUBAR#FUBAR)

The lack of consistency in the sounds, that the letters in English can represent, makes learning to read and spell a real problem for children and foreigners when compared to other orthographies (like German and Spanish spelling).  [Decoding](#decoding) is ambiguous, not only that, so is [encoding](#encoding). 

####There are many LETTERS that can be DECODED in more than one way:
#####o  
Letter|Sound|Example TS| Occurance of Sound Capitalised  
------|-----|----------|---------------------------------  
O|WU| One, Once| WUn, WUnce  
O|U| sOme, Other, cOme, dOes, gOvernment| sUme, Uther, cUme, dUes, gUvernment  
O|I| wOmen| wImen  
O|OO| thrOugh, whO, dO, yOu, schOOl, grOup, fOOd, sOOn, mOve, prOve, lOse| throo, hoo, doo, yoo, schoo??l, groop, foo??d, soo?n, moov, proov, looz  
O|UW|sO ,nO , Only, Over, mOst, knOw, alsO, thOse, Own, bOth|sUW, nUW, UWnly, UWver, mUWst, knUW, alsUW, thUWsw, UWn, bUWth  


####Τhere are many SOUNDS that can be ENCODED in more than one way:     
#####sh   
* SH SHeep, SHIP  
* TI staTIon, raTIo 
* S Sugar, Sure, iSSue 
* CI conCIous

###Previous efforts to ameliorate this nightmare
####Initial teaching alphabets and reference alphabets.

There have been many transitory and reference orthographies (spelling systems and alphabets) developed to aid learners of English. Some of these (UNIFON, ITA - [initial teachinig alphabet] (http://www.omniglot.com/writing/ita.htm), and [Jolly Phonics](http://jollylearning.co.uk/overview-about-jolly-phonics/)) have been used to teach the alphabetic principle free of the extra congnitive overhead of the perversity of the many-to-many mappings from sounds to symbols.

However, these often diverge in form from TS (Traditional Spelling), see [UNIFON](http://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/unifon.htm)



The ITA had a serious flaw when used for too long.  
There are two stages in learning to read.

* understanding the alphabetic principle (needed to decode the words)  
* learning the words-shapes (to recognize the word quickly, by form, so as no to have to decode EVERY SINGLE letter of EVERY word, EVERY time) 
 

ITA was used for too long and many children learnt incorrect word-shape (similar but WRONG). Many claim to have struggled with spelling ever since.
