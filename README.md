PEAdjad
=======

The Phonetic English [Abjad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad) (eg. [Arabic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_Alphabet), [Hebrew](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_Alphabet) is a proposal for an alternate English othography (spelling system). Technically, it is not a pure abjad as occaisonally some vowels are retained. This avoids having, some selected common words, collapsing into homographs (like the [textonyms](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=textonym) - Her neighbour's noisey ???/cock/2625 kept disturbing her sleep. Or any Officer Crabtree-esq 'miscomunications'; a) [th brtsh erfs hv drpd thr bms on th wtrwks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DrAp5gzdqc); b) [.. undr th lmp pst thr ar tw tts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGNVU5ZjlgA)) Additionally the PEAdjad diverges from a tradition abjad in one further respect: some common words are not only contracted by vowel removal, but also by abbrieviation to TLA (three letter acronymn) - eg. government -> gvt.

###Problems with TS (Traditional Spelling)  
* perverse    
lack of consistent phonetic regularity (of symbol -> sound, and sound-> to symbol)  
* verbose   
 a word of [5 letters](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080526032554AAB28AF) specifies (26x26x26x26x26) nearly 12 million combinations which is inefficient encoding of vocabulary sizes which rarely exceed 100 thousand words

###Just TOTALLY [FUBAR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FUBAR#FUBAR)

The lack of consistency in the sounds, that the letters in English can represent, makes learning to read and spell a real problem for learners when compared to other orthographies (like German and Spanish spelling).  [Decoding](#decoding) is ambigous, not only that so is [encoding](#encoding).  

Τħere are many sounds that can be encoded in more than one way:     
sh -  
* SH SHeep, SHIP  
* TI staTIon, raTIo 
* S Sugar, Sure, iSSue 
* CI conCIous

###Previous efforts to ameliorate this nightmare
####Initial teaching alphabets and reference alphabets.

There have been many transitory and reference orthographies (spelling systems and alphabets) developed to aid learners of English. Some of these (UNIFON, ITA - [initial teachinig alphabet] (http://www.omniglot.com/writing/ita.htm), and Jolly Phonics) have been used to teach the alphabetic principle free of the extra congnitive overhead of the perversity of the many-to-many mappings from sounds to symbols.

However, these often diverge in form from TS (Traditional Spelling), see UNIFON
